  * Return version of codebase
  * 
  * This file contains the version of source code distribution. It does not always means the 
  * version installed, just the version of the code. For instance, when you update the files
  * but you don't run the upgrade script - you are still using the old version with new files 
  * ant that means that you are not actualy using new version. You'll most probably end up with 
  * a lot of problems and errors in that situation; they will be gone as soon as your run the 
  * upgrade script.
